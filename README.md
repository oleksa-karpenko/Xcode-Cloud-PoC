# XcodeCloudPoC

This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** project demonstrating how to use **Xcode Cloud** as a CI/CD system for iOS applications.

## About Xcode Cloud

[Xcode Cloud](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/) is Apple native CI/CD solution integrated into App Store Connect. It automates the process of building, testing, analyzing, and archiving your app directly in the cloud.

---

## Workflows Configured

### Default Workflow
Triggered on **any commit** to any branch.

**Steps:**
- **Test**  Fails the flow if any test fails.
- **Analyze**  Fails the flow if any issue is detected.
- **Archive**  Produces build artifacts.

**Post-Actions:**
- Sends **notification** on success or failure (email, Slack, etc.).

### Pull Request Workflow
Triggered on **pull request** to the `main` branch.

**Steps:**
- **Build**  Compiles the application.
- **Test**  Fails the flow if any test fails.
- **Analyze**  Fails the flow if any issue is detected.
- **Archive**  Produces build artifacts.

## Custom CI Scripts

Located in the `ci_scripts/` folder:

- `ci_post_clone.sh`: Installs SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, and Firebase CLI after the repository is cloned.
- `ci_post_xcodebuild.sh`: Uploads the AdHoc `.ipa` build to Firebase App Distribution after the archive is created.

Note: This workflow uses a `release-notes.txt` file to define what's new in each build.

### Environment Variables

Defined in Xcode Cloud workflows:
- `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID`

These are used by the Firebase distribution script to authenticate and upload the build.

## Xcode Cloud Considerations

1. **App Store Connect Registration Required**  
   Even under the Apple Enterprise Development Program, the app **must** be registered in **App Store Connect** to use Xcode Cloud  even if you dont plan to use App Store/TestFlight for distribution.

2. **Enterprise Program Limitations**  
   Enterprise distribution support is **unclear and unofficial**. Xcode Cloud is primarily intended for App Store workflows and may require additional setup for internal distribution.

3. **Global Product Name Collision**  
   Your app name (`ProductName`) must be globally unique in App Store Connect. This may force renaming of modules, bundle IDs, and imports to resolve conflicts.

4. **Remote Workflow Configuration**  
   - Workflows are configured **remotely** in App Store Connect.
   - They are **not version-controlled** or stored in your source code (no `.yml`, `.json`, or `.xcodecloud` files).
   - This **violates Infrastructure-as-Code principles**, reducing reproducibility and auditability.

5. **Environment Differences**
Xcode Cloud’s runtime environment may differ significantly from your local machine — including file paths, available tools, and runtime behavior. For example, while you may be using an Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Mac locally, Xcode Cloud reportedly still runs on Intel-based machines, which can introduce subtle differences (e.g., performance, architecture-specific behavior). To mitigate this, scripts often need to include conditional logic or defensive checks to work reliably in both environments.

6. **Manual Tool Installation Per Run**
Each Xcode Cloud build runs in a clean, stateless environment. This means that every build job requires re-installation and configuration of any additional tools needed for code validation and distribution (e.g., SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, Firebase CLI). This adds overhead and slightly increases the complexity of build scripts.

## What's Good

- **User-friendly interface**.
- **Simultaneous multi-device testing**, including:
  - iPhone 16 Pro Max
  - iPhone 16 Pro
  - iPhone 16
  - iPhone SE (3rd generation)
- **Built-in Slack and Email integration**.
- Automatic management of builds and workflows within App Store Connect.

## Summary

This PoC serves as a foundation for integrating Xcode Cloud into iOS development pipelines, 
especially when evaluating native Apple tooling for automated build/test/archive flows. 
It also highlights key limitations developers should be aware of when working within enterprise contexts.
